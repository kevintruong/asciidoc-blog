== GIT INTERNAL

=== Data structure

Including 3 type of structure

* Blob : hashing of the file's byte (file content in bytes array)

[.text-center]
.Blob object -git internal structure
image::git_strcuture_object-blob.964129b5.png[]
* File Tree : hashing of names and folder definition with file blob.
In another words, File Tree is hashing of filename/folder which blob belong.

[.text-center]
.Tree object - git internal structure
image::git_internal_object-tree.049e94f4.png[]

in another
* Commit: Metadata for author,commit, timestamp and message.
Then hashing the metadata we have hash of commit

[.text-center]
.Commit Object - git internal structure
image::object-commit.076d6b0d.png[]

With 3 types of data structure, Bellow is my thought about them:
When we make commit by command bellow

[source,bash]
----
git add -u # add all modified , prepare for a commit
# for example there are 2 modified files: test1.txt and test2.txt be added
git commit -m "this is my commit"
----

step 1: git will hashing content of added file `test1.txt` and `test2.txt`

[source,text]
----
for example:
test1.txt hashing : 0xabcd
test2.txt hashing : 0xcdef
----

step 2: git also create hahshing filename and its parent folder of added file.
If the hash value is not exist, git will create an entry to stored the new hash value.
step 3: git hashing the metadata of commit.
Here have some tricky:

* the hashing of commit will content the hashing of tree which changed file belong
* Hashing of blob files will be linked to tree.
Each time the file changed will create a new hash for the file. the new hash will add to the tree
* when a file not changed but move or rename , its blob hashing will remain, but it will changed the tree hashing.
At the time, the blod hashing is linked to the new hashing tree.
* We know about metadata hashing that with each commit will hashing the metadata. the hashing metadata contain hashing tree, the hashing tree contained the linked hashing blob of added files. so, from hashing commit we can found hashing blob of added files in the commit.
And also easy to comparing the change between the current with last one.
Simply by vimdiff the current blob with the previous.
Or want to get changing history of a file, git can get the history of the file simple by search in linked list of commit to find all commits which involved changing on the file.

[.text-center]
.GIT Object
image::objects-example.d8743d1c.png[]

For example:

* We want to find info of a commit.

** We know that the commit hashing contained hashing tree,author, timestamp.
from hashing tree contained hashing blob of added files and hashing tree of its parent. with each hashing blob , we can file file changes specific, with each hashing tree parent, we know the change belongs what parent.
The process will be recursived to the GIT ROOT or the the top level of tree folder has changed.
Conclusion, from commit hashing, we know all change in this commit by searching recursive all info linked to its hashing.
* We want to find all change/commit in a folder.

[source,bash]
----
cd "<your git sub folder>"
git log ./
----

** we know about git will store tree hashing of each folder.
Then the work of get all commint/change in a specific folder is simple by searching all commit which have the tree hashing of folder.

By using three different types of structure, git can provide all we need about a source project.

=== Understanding about git rebase and git merge

We already know about git internal.
Basically, there use three types of strureture and linked togeter to to make git become a perfect source version control and basic difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.
The next thing is basic way to use git to manage your source code in a project.

.prepare for merge/rebase
image::merge-rebase01.svg[align="center"]

Short Version:

* Merge takes all the changes in one branch and merges them into another branch in one commit.
* Rebase says I want the point at which I branched to move to a new starting point So when do you use either one?

In another word (Long answer):

* Merge Let's say you have created a branch for the purpose of developing a single feature.
When you want to bring those changes back to master, you probably want merge (you don't care about maintaining all of the interim commits).

.Merge feature to master
image::merge-commit02.svg[align="center"]

* Rebase A second scenario would be if you started doing some development and then another developer made an unrelated change.
You probably want to pull and then rebase to base your changes from the current version from the repo.

.Rebase feature to master
image::rebase-commit03.svg[align="center"]

so, what should I use `git rebase` or `git merge`.
As I thought It depends on your git flow working.
with me, I will use `git rebase` for

==== Git merge

* Git merge explicit (Merge non-fast forward)
** GIT merge command

[source,bash]
----
git checkout feature
git merge master
#or simple just one command to merge feature branch on master
git merge feature master
----

* Description
** git create a new commit with unify the work done in two branch.
The commit will involve 2 parent commit.
One come from the latest commit of the current branch, the other parent is latest parent of master.
We can check it by using command

[source,shell]
----
git cat-file -p "<your commit hashing >"
----

For example

.Git merged master to blog_git_internal_and_my_workflow
image::git_merge_log_graph.jpg[]

As you can see the commit of the merge commit is `d6853ae765c05a3ce7782eda2eec8bcc05fd6887` then the output of command already told above is `git cat-file -p d6853ae765c05a3ce7782eda2eec8bcc05fd6887`.
The return output is

Merge branch 'master' into blog_git_internal_and_my_workflow
----

We could see three involve a tree hashing and 2 different parent.
About 2 parent is the hashing of two commit: one is latest commit of branch master, the other is latest commit of branch `blog_...`.
Take a look on the tree by comment `git ls-tree
1503e53f338437a111672182a563ed577526acf6`.
The return output is

look like the tree is containt hashing of GIT ROOT dir.
The tree will store a hashing of all blob of files contain in ROOT DIR Acording to above section, Each tree contain hashing of all blob its contain.
bellow is more detail about the tree object

.Tree Object, and how it manages its blobs
image::tree_object_linking.png[]

According to the image above, From commit 1, it will link to a tree call `d8329f` , the tree involved a blob of test.txt.
The blob has hashing is `83baae`, the containt of blob simple is text `version 1`.

so, in the second commit, we make a change on test.txt file and also add new file call `new.txt` with its blob hashing is `fa49b0`.
At the time, because there new file added to the folder (new.txt) then git will create another tree object to store the current blob files and also make a change on `test.txt` file from `version 1` to `version 2`.
Then git also create new hashing blob if the file `test.txt` and add it to the new tree object.

about the third commit, we add a new folder (tree) call bak.
Contain the file `test.txt` of first commit and it contains `version 1` as first commit.
so, Again, the hash of tree object is based on the contents of the tree, which means on the names, permissions, types, and hashes of its leaves.
Then the tree object of folder `bak` is the same with tree object of the first commit. `d8329f`.
The I will see in the graph that.
The third commit link to a new tree object, the tree object contains info formation of the old one: blob of test.txt and new.txt, And has a new tree object of `bak`
the tree object of `bak` will have the hash the same with the hashing tree of the first commit.
